        <h1 style="background-color:BurlyWood"> Russo-Ukrainian War</h1> 
        <p>The Russo-Ukrainian War, previously referred to as the Ukrainian crisis in its early stages, is an ongoing international conflict between Russia, alongside Russian-backed separatists, and Ukraine, which began in February 2014. Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity, Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas war. The first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>

      <h2><abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO's</abbr> response to Russia invading Ukraine</h2>
      <p>NATO condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia's brutal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine - which is an independent, peaceful and democratic country, and a close NATO partner. NATO and Allies continue to provide Ukraine with unprecedented levels of support, helping to uphold its fundamental right to self-defence.      </p>
      <h2>Economical ImpactðŸ’°</h2>
      <p>The war in Ukraine has also resulted in significant loss of human capital, destruction of agricultural trading infrastructure, huge damages to productive capacity, including through the loss of electricity, and a reduction in private consumption of more than a third relative to pre-war levels.</p>
      <h2>Teritorrial changes</h2>
      <p>	Russian annexation of Crimea and parts of four southeast Ukrainian oblasts in 2014 and 2022, respectively Russian occupation of about 18% of Ukrainian territory as of November 2022</p>
